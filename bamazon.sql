DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS bamazon;
CREATE DATABASE bamazon;

USE bamazon;
-- 1. Create a MySQL Database called `bamazon`.

-- 2. Then create a Table inside of that database called `products`.

-- 3. The products table should have each of the following columns:

--   * item_id (unique id for each product)

--   * product_name (Name of product)

--   * department_name

--   * price (cost to customer)

--   * stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

-- 4. Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).
